# Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

Using the backtracking algorithm, I have created a sudoku solver. 

Backtracking is simply reverting back to the previous step or solution as soon as we determine that our current solution cannot be continued into a complete one. We will use this principle of backtracking to implement the following algorithm.

Please enjoy a game with a graphical user interface or text based version.
